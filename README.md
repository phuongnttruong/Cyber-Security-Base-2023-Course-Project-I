# Cyber-Security-Base-2023-Course-Project-I
The code presented here is for a website, specifically for part 5 question 21 of the Cyber Security Base 2023 course[Cyber Security Base 2023 course(https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-2.5/1-framework) offered by the University of Helsinki. The website intentionally includes five security flaws from the OWASP 2021 top ten list.

I have explained these flaws, why they are considered security risks, and provided solutions to fix all the issues in the read me file. These fixes are not implemented within the project files themselves, which makes it easier to compare and test the original code against the fixed code.
